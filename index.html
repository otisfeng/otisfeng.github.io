									<p>Retail investors based on the knowledge that many hedge funds had bet heavily on these share prices to go down, having a war with Wall Street and taking down hedge funds make the history.
										But I cannot believe the market either stopped or severely restricted buying by individual traders while allowing everyone to sell, thus suppressing demand and price. 
										And these restrictions were only for retail traders - not hedge funds. 
										This is so unfair that the richs change the game rule to stop the revolution, this is a shame and will be reembered all the time although they keep their fortune.

									<p>Xinjiang cotton got resisted by H&M, Nike and other big Western brands. In my opinion, this action is aiming at the order of Xinjiang province, cotton as the most important product deciding 5 million Xinjiang people's life.
										On the other hand, it also a big attack to Chinese economy by leading the establishment of industry standards, penetrating into the supplier choice, determining the consumer purchase intention.
